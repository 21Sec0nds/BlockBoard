# ${{\color{purple}BlockBoard}}\$

```diff
BlockBoard is an application that gives you a random number and a random letter on your keyboard
After that, the keyboard and mouse are disabled(only 2 keys are not disabled â€” your combination)
So you need to press the combination of the letter and the number to end the loop.
